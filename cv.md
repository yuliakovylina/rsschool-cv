## ABOUT

I'm 35 and have been deeply learning frontend-development for 2 years. I owned a sewing mini-manufacturing, have a strong family business in water pipe manufacturing which is almost 10 years, but still have a desire and intention to immerse into IT sphere.

Due to artistic sense and professional skills in design, and in addition to frontend-skills - I love creating web-sites from the very beginning (idea, product investigation, prototype and design) and till the step of being useful and clear to both sides (my client and his/her customers) from the desktop or mobile screens.
